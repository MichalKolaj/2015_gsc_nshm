##OpenQuake input files for the 2015 Seismic Hazard Model of Canada

This repository provides the input files to replicate (as closely as possible) the Geological Survey of Canada's 2015 Seismic Hazard Model, as used in the 2015 National Building Code of Canada, using the [GEM Foundation's OpenQuake-engine](https://github.com/gem).

##Getting Started
If you just intend to be a user of these input files, you can simply download or clone the master repository:

* git clone https://github.com/treviallen/2015_gsc_nshm.git

To suggest changes and additions, you will have to generate a "fork".  You will need a github user profile to do this. The following web-page describes how to "fork" a repository:
